## *** REQUIRES A COPY OF DOOM 2 TO RUN ***
### Be awesome and buy John Carmack another rocket - he deserves it!

An early build of SRB2 was given to me by my old friend Saxman, who worked with me on Sonic Doom 2 and is best known for starting the Sonic ROM hacking scene. Back in February 2000, I gave him an in-progress build of the game along with a complete copy of the source code.
Recently, we attended Retro World Expo in Hartford, Connecticut in August 2023 together, and he shared with me the original, intact files that I sent him.

Here is a cleaned up copy of the files, with (hopefully) all of the copyrighted DOOM material removed. Perhaps even more interesting, source code is included. At the time, Doom Legacy source code was not exactly 'public' -- you had to e-mail faB and Boris and ask for it. There's some interesting development logs (_LOGS) that provide a lot of insight into Doom Legacy's early development, as well as even a few log entries of my own!

This prototype is early enough, that while custom EXE changes were going on, the WAD files included are remarkably compatible with vanilla Doom Legacy 1.28. The newer player sprites are contained in test2.wad, while the older, original player sprites are in srb2.wad still. I'm sure someone could rewind the clock on the files a little bit, and load up regular Doom Legacy 1.28 (along with test.deh, which is why it is included), set GRAVITY 0.35, and be on their way!

#### File descriptions:
* autoexec.cfg - Sets up some very interesting camera control bindings on boot
* realhpz.wad  - Hidden Palace Zone, possibly the FIRST map ever made for SRB2. So early, it was even started in Boom.
* spdhwy.wad   - Speed Highway At Dawn
* srb2.wad     - What eventually became SRB2.SRB
* srb2test.bat - Handy .BAT file to run the game (noobs use this)
* srb2z1m1.wad - GFZ1 at the time of the prototype. Very similar to SRB2Xmas v0.93
* srb2z1m1_brak.wad - GFZ1, restored to a long-ago test where mini Black Eggmen were inserted into the map
* srb2z1m1_restored.wad - GFZ1, restored to what it would look like before the SRB2Xmas 0.93 edits were made.
* srb2z2*.wad  - Techno Hill
* srb2z3*.wad  - Deep Sea
* srb2z4*.wad  - Mine Maze
* srb2z5*.wad  - Rocky Mountain
* srb2z6*.wad  - Red Volcano
* srb2z7*.wad  - Dark City
* srb2z8*.wad  - Doom Ship (Act 2 was never made)
* srb2z9*.wad  - Robotnirock (Egg Rock - Acts 2 & 3 were never made)
* TUSL.exe     - The Ultimate SRB2 Launcher, an easy way to experiment with command line options
* wood.wad     - Wood Zone, nearly as old as Hidden Palace Zone

#### Pull Requests are welcome! Want to fix a bug? Add the new SDL2 layer? Those are just a few ideas.
